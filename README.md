Interacts with your private [grocy instance](https://grocy.info/)

## About
This [mycroft](https://mycroft-ai.gitbook.io/docs/using-mycroft-ai/get-mycroft) skill enables you to "talk" with [grocy](https://grocy.info).
It requires a running self-hosted instance of [grocy](https://grocy.info)
([Installation](https://github.com/grocy/grocy#how-to-install)).
Currently, the skill has only a limited set of features:
### Examples
* "Put milk on the shopping list"
* "How much bread do we have at home"
* "Remind me what I want to buy"

For "mass" insertion of bought products:
- "I was shopping"  (Mycroft: "What did you buy?")
- "1 Cucumber"
- "1 Milk"
- ...
- "That was all"
- Note: this uses always the default purchase quantity unit

## Known Limitations

Sometimes there are problems to match right product in grocy.
Example: you say: "How many egg***s*** do we have at home?"
If the product in grocy is named "egg", then it isn't found.
